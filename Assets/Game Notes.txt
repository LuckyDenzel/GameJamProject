The game exists out of a player who's goal is to collect biscuits. The player should collect as much biscuits as he possibly can. There's no time limit, but the environment he's in gets more aggressive the longer he collects the biscuits. The player can leave at any time and collect his biscuits. He can also choose to keep going and "risk it for the biscuits". If the player dies, he loses all the biscuits he collected in his run. With the biscuits he collects he can buy upgrades and eventually get stronger and better. Things like speed, more health, more jump force etc.
